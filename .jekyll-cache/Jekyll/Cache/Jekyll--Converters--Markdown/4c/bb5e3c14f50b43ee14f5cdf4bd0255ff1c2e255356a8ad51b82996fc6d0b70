I"ª<h2 id="week-4-social-networks-part-1">Week 4: Social Networks. Part 1.</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s the start of week four in quarantine and things are somehow still not consistent.
Some things that changed this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gillian and I returned to my house.  I returned (semi) permanently.</li>
  <li>Gillian left my house to drive to her home in North Carolina.</li>
  <li>Sam adopted a puppy, Diego, who, like us, pees inside, but unlike us, pees on the floor.</li>
  <li>The temperature reached 70Âº.</li>
  <li>My sheets.</li>
  <li>For two days, not my clothes.</li>
  <li>Sam turned 22.</li>
  <li>I turned 22 and 7/12ths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mostly, the things that changed around me and about me were the people I was/am living with and the ways we communicated. When quarantine began, I stayed with Gillian for about two weeks.  In part because I wanted to, and in part because I had to.  Being immunocompromised during coronavirus means I have to be extra careful. Considering that some of my regular roommates were still working and we all share a single toilet, I thought it best to stay away until they were two weeks out of work.</p>

<p>So, I stayed with Gillian. Until COVID brought more surprises. Two people came in from out of town and needed a place to isolate for two weeks before returning to society because thatâ€™s the world we live in now. Coincidentally, Gillianâ€™s friend was moving out of her apartment for a bit, opening up a room in an apartment with two people who had also been quarantining for two weeks. So the transition started.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Apartment 1:
Gillian &amp; Juliet -&gt; Anael &amp; Elyse

Apartment 2:
Paige, Osmar, &amp; Jesse -&gt; Gillian, Juliet, Osmar, &amp; Jesse

House 1:
Juliet, Sam, Coleen, &amp; Mathea -&gt; Sam Coleen &amp; Mathea

House 2:
No one -&gt; Paige
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The kindness, care, and generosity of friends allowed everyone to have a safe place to live while keeping potential virus spreading to 0.</p>

<p>Finally, when all of my roommates had been out of work for two weeks and Paige needed to come home, Gillian and I gave Paige her room back and returned to my house.  This is where Diego, the baby chihuahua comes in.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Apartment 1:

Gillian, Juliet, Sam, Coleen, &amp; Mathea (and Diego)

House 2:
No one -&gt; 
Paige -&gt; 
No one
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that was not the end. Finally, at the start of week four, Gillian went home to North Carolina and Anael, now officially non-viral, moved to her boyfriend Jackâ€™s house.</p>

<p>All of us are virus free, practicing responsible social distancing, and Purelling the crap out of our hands.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦ Hereâ€™s who I have lived with the past 3+ weeks:</p>
