<p>This week, weâ€™re focusing on text analysis.  Aisling has asked us to take some of the reflections weâ€™ve done since the start of remote classes and put them into the website <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> to see what insights we could gain.  I tried this with all of my blog posts and found that my top 3 words were â€œdataâ€, â€œquarantineâ€, and â€œgroupâ€. Not surprising to me, but still, it is interesting to see that the words that follow those top 3 are the names of the people Iâ€™ve been with throughout this quarantine process.</p>

<p>I find text analysis to be a very interesting topic in data analysis. Although itâ€™s an area I donâ€™t have much experience with, itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been experimenting with on my own time and want to learn more about. I used this weekâ€™s assignment as an opportunity to do that.  To start, I did a sentiment analysis of my blog posts using the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>.  This package is very easy to use and because I just wanted to do a simple analysis, I didnâ€™t get too deep into the â€œbehind the scenesâ€ aspects of sentiment analysis for this project.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was get a basic overall understanding of the different sentiments found in my blog posts:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sentiment.png" alt="sentiments" /></p>

<p>Okayâ€¦ the highest value that comes back is <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> but that is closely followed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code>.  What does this mean? How does it work?</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s happening here is that there is a dictionary of words for each category.  For example, words like â€œgoodâ€, â€œhappyâ€, and â€œsmileâ€ might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> dictionary whereas words like â€œbadâ€, â€œunhappyâ€, and â€œfrownâ€ might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code> dictionary. The text is read one word at a time and if that word is found in one of the dictionaries, it gets counted.  Hereâ€™s an example:</p>

<p>Sentence: â€œI smile when I am happy.  I frown when I am sad.  Today I am feeling good.â€</p>

<p>Our dictionaries might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>positive = 
[
  happy: 1,
  smile: 1,
  laugh: 0,
  good: 1
]

negative = 
[
  sad: 1,
  frown: 1,
  cry: 0,
  bad: 0
]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That puts our total count of positive words at 3 and negative words at 2.  We can classify this sentence as slightly positive.</p>

<p>So this is good.  My blog posts have a lot of words that likely signify positivity, joy, and trust.  They also, however, have a lot of words that signify negativity and sadness.  I wanted to see how this trends over time so I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>â€™s functions to plot how the emotional valence changed.  On this graph, Iâ€™m only looking at positivity (above 0) and negativity (below 0) trends.  This does not reflect every sentence of every blog post, but instead looks at overall trends on a scale that has my most negative sentiment at -1 and most positive sentiment at 1. We can think of it as a scale relative only to my blog posts â€“ not positivity and negativity in general.</p>

<p>Hmmmâ€¦ I donâ€™t love that, but it makes sense.  My motivation and general positivity has decreased since I began quarantining and this is likely reflected through my activities.  Again, this does not mean that my most recent posts are extremely negative.  It just means that compared to my personal baseline in these posts, the more recent posts are more negative than the inital posts.  I anticipated this but I was surprised by the severity of the drop and how strictly downward it moves.</p>
