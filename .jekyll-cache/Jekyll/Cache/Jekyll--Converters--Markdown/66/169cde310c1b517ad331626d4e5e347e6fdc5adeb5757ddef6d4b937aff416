<p><strong>Before you read this post,</strong> understand this ‚Äì mine is not the voice you should prioritize. While I am outraged by the murder of George Floyd, and I hope you are too, the voices we need to listen to, follow, and promote right now are the voices of the black communities in this country.</p>

<p>I am not writing to recount the events of George Floyd‚Äôs murder.  As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/29/heres-why-we-dont-see-protests-when-police-unjustly-kill-white-people/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> put it,</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre white, you can view the footage of Daniel Shaver‚Äôs death, feel some anger and move on. If you‚Äôre black, viewing the video of George Floyd‚Äôs death is a reminder that the throat under Officer Derek Chauvin‚Äôs knee could easily have been your own.‚Äù</p>

<p>The reason I am writing is because as a data analyst, it is clear to me not only from anecdote, but from the numbers, that the United States has a problem with police using force against people of color.  I‚Äôll show you the data briefly for Minneapolis.  Then I‚Äôll offer ways to help that have been promoted by those organizing and involved in the current protests.</p>

<p><strong>White people, don‚Äôt just sit on this information.</strong> Donate money and supplies, engage with local organizations to find out how to help, educate yourselves.  Utilize the privilege that George Floyd didn‚Äôt have to prevent this from happening again and to hold those responsible accountable.</p>

<p><small> The data for the following graphs comes from <a href="http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/6d8110617c4b4971a270ff0834971b89_0/data?selectedAttribute=PoliceUseOfForceID">Open Minneapolis</a> and spans 2008 through 2020.  At the time of use, the most recent update was May 29, 2020). </small></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the basic racial breakdown of incidents of police use of force. To be explicitly clear, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Race</code> here is the race of the person whom the force was inflicted upon.</p>
