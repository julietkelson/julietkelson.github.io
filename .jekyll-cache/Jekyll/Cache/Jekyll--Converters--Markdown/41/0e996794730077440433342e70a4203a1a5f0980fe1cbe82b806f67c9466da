<p>This week, weâ€™re focusing on text analysis.  Aisling has asked us to take some of the reflections weâ€™ve done since the start of remote classes and put them into the website <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> to see what insights we could gain.  I tried this with all of my blog posts and found that my top 3 words were â€œdataâ€, â€œquarantineâ€, and â€œgroupâ€. Not surprising to me, but still, it is interesting to see that the words that follow those top 3 are the names of the people Iâ€™ve been with throughout this quarantine process.</p>

<p>I find text analysis to be a very interesting topic in data analysis. Although itâ€™s an area I donâ€™t have much experience with, itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been experimenting with on my own time and want to learn more about. I used this weekâ€™s assignment as an opportunity to do that.  To start, I did a sentiment analysis of my blog posts using the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>.  This package is very easy to use and because I just wanted to do a simple analysis, I didnâ€™t get too deep into the â€œbehind the scenesâ€ aspects of sentiment analysis for this project.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was get a basic overall understanding of the different sentiments found in my blog posts:</p>

<p><em>This is the fifth in a series of posts <a href="https://julietkelson.github.io/covid/">From Quarantine</a>.  Most posts from quarantine are prompted by Aisling Quigleyâ€™s Data Storytelling class at Macalester College.  This is one of those posts.</em></p>
