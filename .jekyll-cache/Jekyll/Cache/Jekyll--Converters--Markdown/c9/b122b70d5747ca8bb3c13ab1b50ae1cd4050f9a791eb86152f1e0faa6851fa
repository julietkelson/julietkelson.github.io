I"a<h2 id="week-8-late-music">Week 8 (late!): Music.</h2>

<p>This post is being posted in the middle of week nine because of the following excuses that I find valid but you may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finals</li>
  <li>Six hour drive from MN to IL</li>
  <li>My mom’s wedding (in quarantine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Accept it or judge me.  It’s the internet so I’ve prepared myself for both.</p>

<p>Anyway, this week I analyzed my music habits.  I’ve been thinking a lot about music recently because my band, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/geysertheband/">Geyser</a> is finishing up an album.  I know – shameless self promotion. I wanted to see if my music habits have changed since starting quarantine.  I’ll take you through what I found.</p>

<p>I started off by requesting my music listening data from Apple because they don’t have a nice public API like Spotify does.  That took about a week to get and they gave me way more data than I needed, but better too much than too little.  My first question was this: <em>How have my top artists changed?</em></p>

<p>I started off by looking at my all time artists overall (all time being since October, 2015).</p>

<p>I wasn’t really surprised by this. I go through phases where I find an artist I like and listen nonstop.  That covers Brandi Carlile, Chris Stapleton, and Jade Bird.  Wilco and Gillian Welch are another story.  And I wanted to show you that story so check out the next graph.</p>

<p>You can see what I was talking about with the obsessive listening: Each of the three artists I mentioned begins with a steep incline when I start listening to them and then either continues up with each new album they release, or flattens out.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about Gillian Welch.  She’s a long time favorite artist and you see her climbing steadily over time in the graph, but then there’s a sharp uptick in 2020.  That’s because I played her version of Radiohead’s Black Star in a concert and I was trying to learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=attWLjs5WWs">Dave Rawlings’ killer guitar</a> solo note for note.</p>

<p>And finally Wilco. Wilco is the dark blue line. You can see the same pattern that Gillian Welch took where there is a relatively flat but gradual climb and then a quick increase in plays. This one’s slightly embarrassing but what is the internet for if not sharing embarrassing things with the world.  I really like Wilco and their music.  They were one of my first concerts as a kid.  But for the longest time, I felt weird listening to their music because I was friends with the singer’s son and we played music together. But according to this graph, I realized mid-2018 that this was stupid and I listen to their music a lot now because it’s great music and no one cares.</p>

<p>Okay. So I know who my top artists are overall, but who are my top artists in quarantine? Take a look:</p>
