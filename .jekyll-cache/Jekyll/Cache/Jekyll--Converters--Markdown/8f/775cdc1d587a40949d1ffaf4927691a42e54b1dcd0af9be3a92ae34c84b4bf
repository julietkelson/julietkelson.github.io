<p>This week, we’re focusing on text analysis.  Aisling has asked us to take some of the reflections we’ve done since the start of remote classes and put them into the website <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> to see what insights we could gain.  I tried this with all of my blog posts and found that my top 3 words were “data”, “quarantine”, and “group”. Not surprising to me, but still, it is interesting to see that the words that follow those top 3 are the names of the people I’ve been with throughout this quarantine process.</p>

<p>I find text analysis to be a very interesting topic in data analysis. Although it’s an area I don’t have much experience with, it’s something I’ve been experimenting with on my own time and want to learn more about. I used this week’s assignment as an opportunity to do that.  To start, I did a sentiment analysis of my blog posts using the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>.  This package is very easy to use and because I just wanted to do a simple analysis, I didn’t get too deep into the “behind the scenes” aspects of sentiment analysis for this project.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was get a basic overall understanding of the different sentiments found in my blog posts:</p>

<p>Okay… the highest value that comes back is <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> but that is closely followed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code>.  What does this mean? How does it work?</p>

<p>What’s happening here is that there is a dictionary of words for each category.  For example, words like “good”, “happy”, and “smile” might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> dictionary whereas words like “bad”, “unhappy”, and “frown” might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code> dictionary. The text is read one word at a time and if that word is found in one of the dictionaries, it gets counted.  Here’s an example:</p>

<p>Sentence: “I smile when I am happy.  I frown when I am sad.  Today I am feeling good.”</p>

<p>Our dictionaries might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>positive = 
[
  happy: 1,
  smile: 1,
  laugh: 0,
  good: 1
]

negative = 
[
  sad: 1,
  frown: 1,
  cry: 0,
  bad: 0
]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That puts our total count of positive words at 3 and negative words at 2.  We can classify this sentence as slightly positive.</p>

<p>So this is good.  My blog posts have a lot of words that likely signify positivity, joy, and trust.  They also, however, have a lot of words that signify negativity and sadness.  I wanted to see how this trends over time so I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>’s functions to plot how the emotional valence changed.  On this graph, I’m only looking at positivity (above 0) and negativity (below 0).</p>
