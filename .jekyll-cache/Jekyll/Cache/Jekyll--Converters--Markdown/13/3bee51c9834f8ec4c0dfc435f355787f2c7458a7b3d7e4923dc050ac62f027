<p>I am writing this post retroactively because my <a href="https://julietkelson.github.io/covid/">COVID Diaries</a> adventure began during week 3 of my quarantine as a weekly assignment from Aisling Quigley’s Data Storytelling class at Macalester. Being as I have a strong desire for order and consistency, I could not let these posts start at week 3.  It just felt wrong and has been bothering me, so here we are. As I write this, I am in the middle of week 6.  The only reason I know that is because of these posts.  I thought I’d summarize a bit of what weeks one and two looked like for me and, if I can, provide some visualizations as well.</p>

<h3 id="week-1-spring-break">Week 1: Spring Break</h3>

<p>My first week of <em>quasi-</em>quarantine coincided with the first anticipated week of Spring Break.  This was, in large part, a week of cancelled plans.  My roommates and I were supposed to go to New Orleans and I had St Patrick’s Day tickets to a Blackhawks vs. Wild hockey game where I was looking forward to getting beat up for supporting Chicago in my Toews jersey.  But, alas, that was all scrapped and the only plans I did keep were to go “up north” (as they say in Minnesota) with my girlfriend, Gillian. We thought there would be very few people hiking on trails that were either covered in inches of ice and snow and somehow we were right.</p>

<p><em>This is the second in a series of posts <a href="https://julietkelson.github.io/covid/">From Quarantine</a>.  Most posts from quarantine are prompted by Aisling Quigley’s Data Storytelling class at Macalester College.  This is one of those posts.</em></p>
