<p>This week, we’re focusing on text analysis.  Aisling has asked us to take some of the reflections we’ve done since the start of remote classes and put them into the website <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> to see what insights we could gain.  I tried this with all of my blog posts and found that my top 3 words were “data”, “quarantine”, and “group”. Not surprising to me, but still, it is interesting to see that the words that follow those top 3 are the names of the people I’ve been with throughout this quarantine process.</p>

<p>I find text analysis to be a very interesting topic in data analysis. Although it’s an area I don’t have much experience with, it’s something I’ve been experimenting with on my own time and want to learn more about. I used this week’s assignment as an opportunity to do that.  To start, I did a sentiment analysis of my blog posts using the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>.  This package is very easy to use and because I just wanted to do a simple analysis, I didn’t get too deep into the “behind the scenes” aspects of sentiment analysis for this project.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was get a basic overall understanding of the different sentiments found in my blog posts:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sentiment.png" alt="sentiments" /></p>

<p>Okay… the highest value that comes back is <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> but that is closely followed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code>.  What does this mean? How does it work?</p>

<p>What’s happening here is that there is a dictionary of words for each category.  For example, words like “good”, “happy”, and “smile” might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">positive</code> dictionary whereas words like “bad”, “unhappy”, and “frown” might be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">negative</code> dictionary. The text is read one word at a time and if that word is found in one of the dictionaries, it gets counted.  Here’s an example:</p>

<p>Sentence: “I smile when I am happy.  I frown when I am sad.  Today I am feeling good.”</p>

<p>Our dictionaries might look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>positive = 
[
  happy: 1,
  smile: 1,
  laugh: 0,
  good: 1
]

negative = 
[
  sad: 1,
  frown: 1,
  cry: 0,
  bad: 0
]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That puts our total count of positive words at 3 and negative words at 2.  We can classify this sentence as slightly positive.</p>

<p>So this is good.  My blog posts have a lot of words that likely signify positivity, joy, and trust.  They also, however, have a lot of words that signify negativity and sadness.  I wanted to see how this trends over time so I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">syuzhet</code>’s functions to plot how the emotional valence changed.  On this graph, I’m only looking at positivity (above 0) and negativity (below 0) trends.  This does not reflect every sentence of every blog post, but instead looks at overall trends on a scale that has my most negative sentiment at -1 and most positive sentiment at 1. We can think of it as a scale relative only to my blog posts – not positivity and negativity in general.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sentimentPlot.png" alt="sentiments" /></p>

<p>Hmmm… I don’t love that, but it makes sense.  My motivation and general positivity has decreased since I began quarantining and this is likely reflected through my activities.  Again, this does not mean that my most recent posts are extremely negative.  It just means that compared to my personal baseline in these posts, the more recent posts are more negative than the inital posts.  I anticipated this but I was surprised by the severity of the drop and how strictly downward it moves.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to do something completely separate: I wanted to use Markov chains to generate text based on the blog posts I’ve already written.  If you want to understand Markov chains for text generation, <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/making-a-text-generator-using-markov-chains-e17a67225d10">this post</a> does a fairly good job of explaining without getting too mathematical. I will admit, I am no expert in Markov chains, but I find them amusing for text generation and they’re something that I want to learn more about. From a very, very, very high level perspective, Markov chains use probabilities to move from state to state.  In this case, each state is a word and we are looking at the probability that a word will follow the previous word. We keep choosing words this way until we reach the desired amount of words.</p>

<p>I used the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">Markovify</code> for this quick text generation. I told the Markov chain model that it could only replicate either 5 words in a row of the original text (my combined blog posts) or, 40% of a <em>generated</em> sentence could overlap the original text. I set the maximum sentence length to 150 characters and told it to give me only distinct sentences when it generated text.</p>

<p>Because my corpus is fairly small, the model did not have a lot of training material.  This means that the output is very limited in possibility and it probably won’t look like something I wrote.  If we gave it the entire Shakespeare corpus, it might be able to replicate his style (to a point), but my ~4,200 words don’t provide much material for the model to learn my writing style.  but I did it anyway because it’s funny.  Here’s an excerpt from the generated text:</p>

<p align="center">Sam's birthday is April 9th, and this graph is that I have a group without Sam? For now, I think most young people have a handy little device in my Toews jersey. Gillian moves back to my walking pre-COVID. Now, here's why I don't have time for that. Quarantining is a narcissistic graph about me and I need another group to communicate in? Considering that some of my roommates had been out of hot spots, etc.. We can look at the start of week 6. I'll keep track of these edges are necessary in the same floor as someone else or not. This group can be used, and how they change. Let's look at the start of quarantine. My first week I am no constitutional expert and I'm in here living with my roommates. You might notice that this is the first week of canceled plans. Why would Maddie, Shane, Secret People Why would they need to be around. Some things that changed around me and about me and I could find your name. I'll keep track of these edges are necessary in the *Stay Yo Ass At Home* chat. That's the first week of canceled plans. Rosh Squad: Me, Maddie, Shane, Secret People Why would they need to be extra careful. My mom is the least connected one node is in talks for the virus? Two people came in from out of a box of Rice Krispies pedometer, I have more than my sister. This data is not one but two weeks out of a node. That's the first one: In this graph was created April 7th. Unsurprisingly, I have to be in a group to communicate in? Because there is a narcissistic graph about me and about me and I had to. This was, in large part, a week of *quasi-*quarantine coincided with the concept of the members are already in a group to dis her in person. That's the first week I am at least that's what I found in the same floor as someone else or not. My first experiences with self-tracking at all times tracking much of what I found out that for some reason I know about. Because there is a struggle. As I write this, I am no constitutional expert and I'm in here living with and the horizontal line shows the trend turns downward. Let's say I'm looking at your phone in the same office every day. For now, I think most young people have a safe place to isolate for two weeks. I think most young people have a safe place to isolate for two weeks. Let's say I'm looking at your door while you spy from the graph, *Rosh Squad* exists – to appease Shane. That's the first week I am in the family. With the quantified self, we're trying to make GPS tracking more accurate, I don't have time for that. This is not one but two weeks out of my cute dog, Roshi. This group will soon be moved from the start of quarantine. Mostly, the things that changed around me and I were supposed to go to a party? <br /> So, all of the members are already in a group without Sam? He doesn't want to be safer with your co-worker. Unsurprisingly, I have an obnoxiously unnecessary number of edges going into or out of hot spots, etc.. Finally, at the first problem. Being as I am in. Two people came in from out of my texting is to my walking pre-COVID. <br /> Samuca and the horizontal line shows the start of week 6. This graph is that I had to. <br /> nothing is important here: Me, Coleen, Sam, Mathea This group will soon change. Coincidentally, Gillian's friend was moving out of work for two weeks of Spring Break. That's the first anticipated week of *quasi-*quarantine coincided with the concept of the week meaning less face-to-face communication. There is a narcissistic graph about me and about me and I need another group to communicate in? You might notice that this is the least connected one in the *Stay Yo Ass At Home* chat. I might pull all of my cute dog, Roshi. Coincidentally, Gillian's friend was moving out of a box of Rice Krispies pedometer, I have to be safer with your own technology. I might pull all of the quantified self, we're trying to walk around a different group together. Finally, when all of these because my phone to look at the start of 2017 through today. My point is, while there are potential upsides to using cell phone data to track social distancing and contamination. Unsurprisingly, I have a good understanding that when I don't have time for that. Self tracking is something I think most young people have a handy little device in my Toews jersey. My roommates and I returned to my walking pre-COVID. If we remove Shane from the start of week four in quarantine and the ways we communicated. Since I started quarantining, the people I was/am living with and the horizontal line shows the trend turns downward. The New York Times series, I began quarantining is my steps. Sam's birthday is April 9th, and this graph is that I have more than I know that is because of these edges are necessary in the same people. Sam is the first problem. My first week of *quasi-*quarantine coincided with the concept of the members are already in a group without Sam? <br /> nothing is important here: Me, Coleen, Sam, Mathea This group seems unnecessary too, right? We can look at the start of quarantine. We already have a safe place to isolate for two weeks. Normally I'd be living at home and go to New Orleans and I need another group to communicate in? <br /> Samuca and the Newts: Me, Coleen, Mathea This group seems unnecessary too, right? Thinking about social networks are all out of hot spots, etc.. <br /> nothing is important here: Me, Coleen, Sam, Mathea This group can be used, and how to be bothered. Sure, there are ways to make sure I am finally doing now, with my roommates. I'll keep track of these edges are necessary in the middle of week 6. This graph is that I have an obnoxiously unnecessary number of edges going into or out of work. I think most young people have a group to dis her in person. Normally I'd be living at home and go to New Orleans and I had to. What if two people who are connected to each other. But with the concept of the members are already in a group without Sam? Thinking about social networks are all out of work for two weeks. If we remove Shane from the start of quarantine and the ways we communicated. As I write this, I am in the same floor as someone else or not. Being as I am trying to walk around a different group together. Unsurprisingly, I have a group to communicate in? Self tracking is something I think most young people have a group to dis her in person. <br /> Samuca and the Newts: Me, Coleen, Mathea This group exists for the virus? He doesn't want to be in a different group together. But with the concept of the members are already in a group to communicate in? You might notice that this is the first anticipated week of canceled plans. With the quantified self, we're trying to walk around a different group together. And God forbid you forget your phone at home and go to New Orleans and I need another group to communicate in? You might notice that this is the least connected one node is in talks for the virus? Since I started walking more in college as I am no constitutional expert and I'm in here living with and the ways we communicated.</p>
