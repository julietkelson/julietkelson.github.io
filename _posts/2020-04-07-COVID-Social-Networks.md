## Week 4: Social Networks. Part 1.
It's the start of week four in quarantine and things are somehow still not consistent.
Some things that changed this week:

- Gillian and I returned to my house.  I returned (semi) permanently.
- Gillian left my house to drive to her home in North Carolina.
- Sam adopted a puppy, Diego, who, like us, pees inside, but unlike us, pees on the floor.
- The temperature reached 70ยบ.
- My sheets.
- For two days, not my clothes.
- Sam turned 22.
- I turned 22 and 7/12ths.

Mostly, the things that changed around me and about me were the people I was/am living with and the ways we communicated. When quarantine began, I stayed with Gillian for about two weeks.  In part because I wanted to, and in part because I had to.  Being immunocompromised during coronavirus means I have to be extra careful. Considering that some of my regular roommates were still working and we all share a single toilet, I thought it best to stay away until they were two weeks out of work.

So, I stayed with Gillian. Until COVID brought more surprises. Two people came in from out of town and needed a place to isolate for two weeks before returning to society because that's the world we live in now. Coincidentally, Gillian's friend was moving out of her apartment for a bit, opening up a room in an apartment with two people who had also been quarantining for two weeks. So the transition started.

```
Apartment 1:
Gillian & Juliet -> Anael & Elyse

Apartment 2:
Paige, Osmar, & Jesse -> Gillian, Juliet, Osmar, & Jesse

House 1:
Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea -> Sam Coleen & Mathea

House 2:
No one -> Paige
```

The kindness, care, and generosity of friends allowed everyone to have a safe place to live while keeping potential virus spreading to 0.  

Finally, when all of my roommates had been out of work for two weeks and Paige needed to come home, Gillian and I gave Paige her room back and returned to my house.  This is where Diego, the baby chihuahua comes in.

```
Apartment 1:
Gillian & Juliet -> 
Anael & Elyse

Apartment 2:
Paige, Osmar, & Jesse -> 
Gillian, Juliet, Osmar, & Jesse -> 
Paige, Osmar, & Jesse

House 1:
Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea -> 
Sam Coleen & Mathea -> 
Gillian, Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea (and Diego)

House 2:
No one -> 
Paige -> 
No one
```

But that was not the end. Finally, at the start of week four, Gillian went home to North Carolina and Anael, now officially non-viral, moved to her boyfriend Jack's house.

```
Apartment 1:
Gillian & Juliet -> 
Anael & Elyse -> 
Elyse

Apartment 2:
Paige, Osmar, & Jesse -> 
Gillian, Juliet, Osmar, & Jesse -> 
Paige, Osmar, & Jesse

House 1:
Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea -> 
Sam Coleen & Mathea -> 
Gillian, Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea (and Diego) -> 
Juliet, Sam, Coleen, & Mathea (and Diego)

House 2:
No one -> 
Paige -> 
No one

House 3:
Anael, Jack, & others

House 4:
Gillian & family
```

All of us are virus free, practicing responsible social distancing, and Purelling the crap out of our hands.

So... Here's who I have lived with the past 3+ weeks:
